### 👋 Welcome to CodeBytes

This repo is my personal learning vault — a growing collection of bite-sized code snippets, patterns, and concepts I explore daily as a developer.

Whether it's a tricky JavaScript behavior, a clean React pattern, a backend trick with Go or Node.js, or a neat CI/CD workflow — you'll find it here in simple, digestible form.

Think of this as a mix between my second brain 🧠 and my public notebook 📓.
