Hey everyone! 👋

This is the beginning of a new experiment — I'm using this repository as a personal dev journal.

Every time I learn something cool (or even confusing 😅), I'll post a small snippet here — from code patterns and behaviors to backend insights and dev tools.

And thanks to automation, you’ll see these updates shared on Twitter and LinkedIn automatically. 🛠️

Let’s build in public. Let’s grow together.
